The L1 muon trigger system uses resistive-plate chambers (RPCs) to generate the muon-induced trigger signals in the central (barrel) region of the ATLAS detector. The ATLAS RPCs are arranged in six concentric layers and operate in a toroidal magnetic field with a bending power of 1.5 to 5.5 Tm.

Detector and trigger performance are studied using $Z$ boson decays into a muon pair. Measurements of the RPC detector response, efficiency, and time resolution are reported. Measurements of the L1 muon barrel trigger efficiencies and rates are presented, along with measurements of the properties of the selected sample of muon candidates. Measurements of the RPC currents, counting rates and mean avalanche charge are performed using zero-bias collisions.

In this document, a new method to account for these additional interactions in the simulation chain is described. Instead of sampling the inelastic interactions and adding their energy deposits to a hard-scatter interaction one-by-one, the inelastic interactions are presampled, independent of the hard scatter, and stored as combined events. Consequently, for each hard-scatter interaction only one such presampled event needs to be added as part of the simulation chain.

Since the formulation of the Standard Model, the observation of flavour oscillations among neutrinos (the neutral leptons) has demonstrated that neutrinos have mass and in neutrino weak interactions the lepton flavour is not conserved. To date, there is no experimental evidence that lepton flavour violation occurs in interactions between charged leptons, and an observation of such a phenomenon would be an exciting sign of new particles or new type of interactions beyond the Standard Model.

The benchmark signal signature is a two-quark and two-lepton contact interaction, which would enhance the dilepton event rate at the TeV mass scale. To model the contribution from background processes a functional form is fit to the dilepton invariant-mass spectra in data in a mass region below the region of interest. It is then extrapolated to a high-mass signal region to obtain the expected background there. No significant deviation from the expected background is observed in the data. Upper limits at 95% CL on the number of events and the visible cross-section times branching fraction for processes involving new physics are provided. Observed (expected) 95% CL lower limits on the contact interaction energy scale reach 35.8 (37.6) TeV.[graphic not available: see fulltext]"},{"Short Title":"Top-quark pair differential cross-sections in the resolved hadronic channel","Group":"TOPQ","Journal reference":"JHEP 01 (2021) 033","doi":"10.1007\/JHEP01(2021)033","Submitted on":"16-JUN-20","L":"36 fb-1","\u221as (TeV)":"13","Links":"Documents | 2006.09274 | Inspire\nHepData | Internal","inspire_id":"1801434","title":"Measurements of top-quark pair single- and double-differential cross-sections in the all-hadronic channel in $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13~\\textrm{TeV}$ using the ATLAS detector","keywords":["p p: colliding beams","top: transverse momentum","top: pair production","p p: scattering","ATLAS","final state: ((n)jet)","differential cross section: measured","CERN LHC Coll","numerical calculations: Monte Carlo","correlation","decay modes","kinematics","CERN Lab","mass spectrum: (2top)","transverse momentum dependence","rapidity dependence","mass dependence","jet: multiplicity","multiplicity: dependence","parton","experimental results","13000 GeV-cms"],"abstract":"Differential cross-sections are measured for top-quark pair production in the all-hadronic decay mode, using proton-proton collision events collected by the ATLAS experiment in which all six decay jets are separately resolved.

Azimuthal anisotropies, quantified by flow coefficients, are measured via the event-plane method for inclusive heavy-flavor muons as a function of the muon pT and in intervals of Pb+Pb collision centrality. Heavy-flavor muons are separated into contributions from charm and bottom hadron decays using the muon transverse impact parameter with respect to the event primary vertex.

This paper presents the monitoring and assessment procedures in place at ATLAS during 2015\u20132018 data-taking. Through the continuous improvement of operational procedures, ATLAS achieved a high data quality efficiency, with 95.6% of the recorded proton-proton collision data collected at $\\sqrt {s}$ =13 TeV certified for physics analysis."},{"Short Title":"Inclusive single diffractive dissociation cross-section of pp collisions at 8 TeV","Group":"STDM","Journal reference":"JHEP 02 (2020) 042","doi":"10.1007\/JHEP02(2020)042","Submitted on":"01-NOV-19","L":"24.11 nb-1","\u221as (TeV)":"8","Links":"Documents | 1911.00453 | Inspire\n| Internal","inspire_id":"1762584","title":"Measurement of differential cross sections for single diffractive dissociation in $\\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV $pp$ collisions using the ATLAS ALFA spectrometer","keywords":["p p: colliding beams","diffraction: dissociation","p p: scattering","p: inclusive production","p: final state","rapidity: gap","ATLAS","differential cross section: measured","energy dependence","momentum transfer dependence","rapidity dependence","forward spectrometer","charged particle","CERN LHC Coll","spectrometer","p: energy loss","fractional","pomeron","slope","Regge","experimental results","8000 GeV-cms"],"abstract":"A dedicated sample of Large Hadron Collider proton-proton collision data at centre-of-mass energy $ \\sqrt{s} $ = 8 TeV is used to study inclusive single diffractive dissociation, pp \u2192 X p.

The signal yield is determined from fits of the data-driven background templates to the different jet mass distributions for the two grooming methods. Integrated fiducial cross-sections and unfolded jet mass spectra for each grooming method are compared with leading-order theoretical predictions.

These cumulants provide information on the event-by-event fluctuations of harmonic flow coefficients v$_{n}$ and correlated fluctuations between two harmonics v$_{n}$ and v$_{m}$. For the first time, a non-zero four-particle cumulant is observed for dipolar flow, v$_{1}$. The four-particle cumulants for elliptic flow, v$_{2}$, and triangular flow, v$_{3}$, exhibit a strong centrality dependence and change sign in ultra-central collisions. This sign change is consistent with significant non-Gaussian fluctuations in v$_{2}$ and v$_{3}$. The four-particle cumulant for quadrangular flow, v$_{4}$, is found to change sign in mid-central collisions. Correlations between two harmonics are studied with three- and four-particle mixed-harmonic cumulants, which indicate an anti-correlation between v2 and v3, and a positive correlation between v$_{2}$ and v$_{4}$. These correlations decrease in strength towards central collisions and either approach zero or change sign in ultra-central collisions. To investigate the possible flow fluctuations arising from intrinsic centrality or volume fluctuations, the results are compared between two different event classes used for centrality definitions. In peripheral and mid-central collisions where the cumulant signals are large, only small differences are observed. In ultra-central collisions, the differences are much larger and transverse momentum dependent. These results provide new information to disentangle flow fluctuations from the initial and final states, as well as new insights on the influence of centrality fluctuations.[graphic not available: see fulltext]"},{"Short Title":"Observation of light-by-light scattering in 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb","Group":"HION","Journal reference":"Phys.

Results are interpreted assuming the pair production of R -hadrons as composite colourless states of a long-lived gluino and Standard Model partons.

A data selection with a significant deviation defines a signal region for a dedicated follow-up analysis with an improved background expectation. The analysis of the data-derived signal regions on a new dataset allows a statistical interpretation without the large look-elsewhere effect.

The measurement covers photon transverse energies 25<ET\u03b3<400 GeV and 25<ET\u03b3<350 GeV respectively for the two |\u03b7\u03b3| regions. For each jet flavour, the ratio of the cross sections in the two |\u03b7\u03b3| regions is also measured. The measurement is corrected for detector effects and compared to leading-order and next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations, based on various treatments and assumptions about the heavy-flavour content of the proton. Overall, the predictions agree well with the measurement, but some deviations are observed at high photon transverse energies. The total uncertainty in the measurement ranges between 13% and 66%, while the central \u03b3+b measurement exhibits the smallest uncertainty, ranging from 13% to 27%, which is comparable to the precision of the theoretical predictions."},{"Short Title":"Resonance search in the VV to lvqq final state","Group":"EXOT","Journal reference":"JHEP 03 (2018) 042","doi":"10.1007\/JHEP03(2018)042","Submitted on":"19-OCT-17","L":"36 fb-1","\u221as (TeV)":"13","Links":"Documents | 1710.07235 | Inspire\nHepData | Briefing | Internal","inspire_id":"1631642","title":"Search for $WW\/WZ$ resonance production in $\\ell \\nu qq$ final states in $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s} =$ 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector","keywords":["p p: colliding beams","W: pair production","Z0: associated production","resonance: production","narrow resonance","p p: scattering","W: leptonic decay","W: hadronic decay","Z0: hadronic decay","final state: ((n)jet lepton)","vector boson: fusion","resonance: scalar","resonance: mass","Z': mass: lower limit","W': mass: lower limit","quark antiquark: annihilation","graviton: Kaluza-Klein","spin: 2","gluon gluon: fusion","vector boson: heavy","channel cross section: upper limit","mass dependence","ATLAS","CERN LHC Coll","gravitation","background","benchmark","statistical analysis","data analysis method","experimental results","13000 GeV-cms"],"abstract":"A search is conducted for new resonances decaying into a W W or W Z boson pair, where one W boson decays leptonically and the other W or Z boson decays hadronically.

The azimuthal correlations are probed using four-particle cumulants cn{4} and flow coefficients vn{4}=(\u2212cn{4})1\/4 for n=2 and 3, with the goal of extracting long-range multiparticle azimuthal correlation signals and suppressing the short-range correlations. The values of cn{4} are obtained as a function of the average number of charged particles per event, Nch, using the recently proposed two-subevent and three-subevent cumulant methods, and compared with results obtained with the standard cumulant method. The standard method is found to be strongly biased by short-range correlations, which originate mostly from jets with a positive contribution to cn{4}. The three-subevent method, on the other hand, is found to be least sensitive to short-range correlations. The three-subevent method gives a negative c2{4}, and therefore a well-defined v2{4}, nearly independent of Nch, which implies that the long-range multiparticle azimuthal correlations persist to events with low multiplicity. Furthermore, v2{4} is found to be smaller than the v2{2} measured using the two-particle correlation method, as expected for long-range collective behavior. Finally, the measured values of v2{4} and v2{2} are used to estimate the number of sources relevant for the initial eccentricity in the collision geometry. The results based on the subevent cumulant technique provide direct evidence, in small collision systems, for a long-range collectivity involving many particles distributed across a broad rapidity interval."},{"Short Title":"Gluino pair, squark pair; 0 lepton, high jet multiplicity","Group":"SUSY","Journal reference":"JHEP12 (2017) 034","doi":"10.1007\/JHEP12(2017)034","Submitted on":"10-AUG-17","L":"36 fb-1","\u221as (TeV)":"13","Links":"Documents | 1708.02794 | Inspire\nHepData | Internal","inspire_id":"1615205","title":"Search for new phenomena with large jet multiplicities and missing transverse momentum using large-radius jets and flavour-tagging at ATLAS in 13 TeV $pp$ collisions","keywords":["p p: colliding beams","jet: multiplicity","p p: scattering","transverse momentum: missing-energy","ATLAS","minimal supersymmetric standard model","CERN LHC Coll","supersymmetry","R parity: violation","R parity: invariance","new physics: search for","jet: bottom","bottom: particle identification","gluino: pair production","data analysis method","experimental results","13000 GeV-cms"],"abstract":"A search is presented for particles that decay producing a large jet multiplicity and invisible particles.

Two-particle correlation functions and the extracted source radii are presented as a function of collision centrality as well as the average transverse momentum (kT) and rapidity (y\u03c0\u03c0\u2605) of the pair. Pairs are selected with a rapidity \u22122<y\u03c0\u03c0\u2605<1 and with an average transverse momentum 0.1<kT<0.8GeV. The effect of jet fragmentation on the two-particle correlation function is studied, and a method using opposite-charge pair data to constrain its contributions to the measured correlations is described. The measured source sizes are substantially larger in more central collisions and are observed to decrease with increasing pair kT. A correlation of the radii with the local charged-particle density is demonstrated. The scaling of the extracted radii with the mean number of participating nucleons is also used to compare a selection of initial-geometry models. The cross term Rol is measured as a function of rapidity, and a nonzero value is observed with 5.1\u03c3 combined significance for \u22121<y\u03c0\u03c0\u2605<1 in the most central events."},{"Short Title":"Jet reconstruction and performance using particle flow with the ATLAS Detector","Group":"JETM","Journal reference":"Eur.

The paper places emphasis on how this is achieved, while minimising double-counting of charged-hadron signals between the inner tracker and calorimeter.

Many extensions of the Standard Model predict the existence of massive charged long-lived particles, such as R-hadrons.

The search presented here has much greater sensitivity than a similar search performed using the ATLAS detector in the s=8\u2009\u2009TeV data set, thanks to the increase in expected signal cross section due to the higher center-of-mass energy of collisions, to an upgraded detector with a new silicon layer close to the interaction point, and to analysis improvements.

This paper presents a measurement of the distribution of momentum-weighted sums, called jet charge, in dijet events using 20.3\u2009\u2009fb-1 of data recorded with the ATLAS detector at s=8\u2009\u2009TeV in pp collisions at the LHC. The jet charge distribution is unfolded to remove distortions from detector effects and the resulting particle-level distribution is compared with several models. The pT dependence of the jet charge distribution average and standard deviation are compared to predictions obtained with several leading-order and next-to-leading-order parton distribution functions. The data are also compared to different Monte\u00a0Carlo simulations of QCD dijet production using various settings of the free parameters within these models. The chosen value of the strong coupling constant used to calculate gluon radiation is found to have a significant impact on the predicted jet charge. There is evidence for a pT dependence of the jet charge distribution for a given jet flavor. In agreement with perturbative QCD predictions, the data show that the average jet charge of quark-initiated jets decreases in magnitude as the energy of the jet increases."},{"Short Title":"Stop pair; 0-1 lepton, taus","Group":"SUSY","Journal reference":"Eur.

The p+Pb collision centrality was characterised using the total transverse energy measured in the pseudorapidity interval \u22124.9<\u03b7<\u22123.2 in the direction of the lead beam. Results are presented for the double-differential per-collision yields as a function of jet rapidity and transverse momentum ( pT ) for minimum-bias and centrality-selected p+Pb collisions, and are compared to the jet rate from the geometric expectation. The total jet yield in minimum-bias events is slightly enhanced above the expectation in a pT -dependent manner but is consistent with the expectation within uncertainties. The ratios of jet spectra from different centrality selections show a strong modification of jet production at all pT at forward rapidities and for large pT at mid-rapidity, which manifests as a suppression of the jet yield in central events and an enhancement in peripheral events. These effects imply that the factorisation between hard and soft processes is violated at an unexpected level in proton\u2013nucleus collisions. Furthermore, the modifications at forward rapidities are found to be a function of the total jet energy only, implying that the violations may have a simple dependence on the hard parton\u2013parton kinematics."},{"Short Title":"H(125) H-> WW couplings","Group":"HIGG","Journal reference":"Phys.

Events consistent with hadronic decays of top\u2013antitop quark pairs with at least six jets in the final state are selected. The substantial background from multijet production is modelled with data-driven methods that utilise the number of identified $b$ -quark jets and the transverse momentum of the sixth leading jet, which have minimal correlation. The top-quark mass is obtained from template fits to the ratio of three-jet to dijet mass. The three-jet mass is calculated from the three jets produced in a top-quark decay. Using these three jets the dijet mass is obtained from the two jets produced in the $W$ boson decay. The top-quark mass obtained from this fit is thus less sensitive to the uncertainty in the energy measurement of the jets. A binned likelihood fit yields a top-quark mass of $\\begin{aligned} m_{t} = 175.1 \\pm 1.4\\,\\text{(stat.) }\\pm 1.2\\,\\text{(syst.) }\\mathrm{\\,GeV}. \\end{aligned}$"},{"Short Title":"H(125) H-> gamma gamma couplings","Group":"HIGG","Journal reference":"Phys.

Differential cross-sections are presented as a function of the jet multiplicity for up to eight jets using jet transverse momentum thresholds of 25, 40, 60, and 80 GeV, and as a function of jet transverse momentum up to the fifth jet. The results are shown after background subtraction and corrections for all known detector effects, within a kinematic range closely matched to the experimental acceptance. Several QCD-based Monte Carlo models are compared with the results. Sensitivity to the parton shower modelling is found at the higher jet multiplicities, at high transverse momentum of the leading jet and in the transverse momentum spectrum of the fifth leading jet.

The lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is taken to be the lightest neutralino which only interacts weakly and is assumed to be stable. The stop decay modes considered are those to a top quark and the LSP as well as to a bottom quark and the lightest chargino, where the chargino decays to the LSP by emitting a W boson. A wide range of scenarios with different mass splittings between the stop, the lightest neutralino and the lightest chargino are considered, including cases where the W bosons or the top quarks are off-shell. Decay modes involving the heavier charginos and neutralinos are addressed using a set of phenomenological models of supersymmetry. No significant excess over the Standard Model prediction is observed. A stop with a mass between 210 and 640 GeV decaying directly to a top quark and a massless LSP is excluded at 95% confidence level, and in models where the mass of the lightest chargino is twice that of the LSP, stops are excluded at 95% confidence level up to a mass of 500 GeV for an LSP mass in the range of 100 to 150 GeV. Stringent exclusion limits are also derived for all other stop decay modes considered, and model-independent upper limits are set on the visible cross-section for processes beyond the Standard Model."},{"Short Title":"Simultaneous measurements of ttbar, WW, and Z\/gamma* -> tau tau cross sections at 7 TeV","Group":"TOPQ","Journal reference":"Phys.

The shapes of the v_n distributions are described by a two-dimensional Gaussian function for the underlying flow vector in central collisions for v_2 and over most of the measured centrality range for v_3 and v_4. Significant deviations from this function are observed for v_2 in mid-central and peripheral collisions, and a small deviation is observed for v_3 in mid-central collisions.

The JES is validated for jet transverse momenta up to 1 TeV to the level of a few percent using several in situ techniques by comparing a well-known reference such as the recoiling photon pt, the sum of the transverse momenta of tracks associated to the jet, or a system of low-pt jets recoiling against a high-pt jet. More sophisticated jet calibration schemes are presented based on calorimeter cell energy density weighting or hadronic properties of jets, providing an improved jet energy resolution and a reduced flavour dependence of the jet response.

The dominant uncertainty comes from the jet energy scale, which is determined to within 7% for central jets above 60 GeV transverse momentum. Inclusive single-jet differential cross sections are presented as functions of jet transverse momentum and rapidity.
