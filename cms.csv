The theoretical description of these nonperturbative processes, which have not yet been measured in detail at the LHC, poses a significant challenge to models. The two pions are measured and identified in the CMS silicon tracker based on specific energy loss, whereas the absence of other particles is ensured by calorimeter information. The total and differential cross sections of exclusive and semiexclusive central production are measured as functions of invariant mass, transverse momentum, and rapidity of the system in the fiducial region defined as transverse momentum and pseudorapidity . The production cross sections for the four resonant channels [inline-graphic not available: see fulltext], , [inline-graphic not available: see fulltext], and [inline-graphic not available: see fulltext]are extracted using a simple model.

When fitting the signed lepton pseudorapidity distribution of these events with predicted distributions from an admixture of diffractive (POMPYT) and non-diffractive (PYTHIA) Monte Carlo simulations, the diffractive component is determined to be (50.0 +/- 9.3 (stat.) +/- 5.2 (syst.))%.","['charged particle: multiplicity', 'rapidity: gap', 'numerical calculations: Monte Carlo', 'diffraction', 'energy flow: small-angle', 'CERN LHC Coll', 'correlation', 'PYTHIA', 'CMS', 'calorimeter: hadronic', 'energy loss', 'p p: inclusive reaction', 'intermediate boson: hadroproduction', 'W: leptonic decay', 'Z0: leptonic decay', 'hard scattering', 'parton: multiple scattering', 'underlying event', 'experimental results', 'p p --> intermediate boson anything', 'W --> lepton neutrino', 'Z0 --> muon+ muon-', '7000 GeV-cms']",10.1140/epjc/s10052-011-1839-3,

In the first one, targeting lower vector boson transverse momentum, the H boson candidate is reconstructed via two resolved jets arising from the two charm quarks from the H boson decay. A second strategy identifies the case where the two charm quark jets from the H boson decay merge to form a single jet, which generally only occurs when the vector boson has higher transverse momentum. Both strategies make use of novel methods for charm jet identification, while jet substructure techniques are also exploited to suppress the background in the merged-jet topology.

The analysis uses the CERN LHC proton-proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS and CMS experiments in 2011 and 2012, corresponding to integrated luminosities per experiment of approximately 5 fb$^{−1}$ at $ \sqrt{s}=7 $ TeV and 20 fb$^{−1}$ at $ \sqrt{s}=8 $ TeV. The Higgs boson production and decay rates measured by the two experiments are combined within the context of three generic parameterisations: two based on cross sections and branching fractions, and one on ratios of coupling modifiers. Several interpretations of the measurements with more model-dependent parameterisations are also given. The combined signal yield relative to the Standard Model prediction is measured to be 1.09 ± 0.11. The combined measurements lead to observed significances for the vector boson fusion production process and for the H → ττ decay of 5.4 and 5.5 standard deviations, respectively. The data are consistent with the Standard Model predictions for all parameterisations considered.","['p p: colliding beams', 'Higgs particle: hadroproduction', 'Higgs particle: decay modes', 'vector boson: fusion', 'Higgs particle: decay rate', 'decay rate: measured', 'Higgs particle: mass', 'gluon: fusion', 'p p: scattering', 'Higgs particle: coupling', 'ATLAS', 'CMS', 'CERN LHC Coll', 'vector boson: associated production', 'top: associated production', 'Higgs particle: branching ratio', 'channel cross section: measured', 'CERN Lab', 'experimental results', '7000 GeV-cms', '8000 GeV-cms']",10.1007/JHEP08(2016)045,

Since the first observation in decays to gamma gamma, WW, and ZZ boson pairs, an extensive set of measurements of the mass and couplings to W and Z bosons, as well as multiple tests of the spin-parity quantum numbers, have revealed that the properties of the new boson are consistent with those of the long-sought agent responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking. An important open question is whether the new particle also couples to fermions, and in particular to down-type fermions, since the current measurements mainly constrain the couplings to the up-type top quark. Determination of the couplings to down-type fermions requires direct measurement of the corresponding Higgs boson decays, as recently reported by the CMS experiment in the study of Higgs decays to bottom quarks and tau leptons.

When compared to Monte Carlo event generators, the radial distribution in pp collisions is found to be well described by pythia, while the slope of the distribution predicted by sherpa is steeper than that of the data. In Pb-Pb collisions, compared to the pp results, the D0 meson distribution for 4<pTD<20  GeV/c hints at a larger distance on average with respect to the jet axis, reflecting a diffusion of charm quarks in the medium created in heavy ion collisions.

Predictions of groomed jet properties from the pythia and herwig++ event generators agree with the measurements in pp collisions. When comparing the results from the most central PbPb collisions to pp data, a hint of an increase of jets with large jet mass is observed, which could originate from additional medium-induced radiation at a large angle from the jet axis.

Two-particle azimuthal correlations have been extensively used to study hydrodynamic flow in heavy ion collisions. Recently it was shown that the expected factorization of two-particle results into a product of the constituent single-particle anisotropies is broken. The new information provided by these modes may shed light on the breakdown of flow factorization in heavy ion collisions. The first two modes (“leading” and “subleading”) of two-particle correlations are presented for elliptical and triangular anisotropies in PbPb and pPb collisions as a function of pT over a wide range of event activity. The leading mode is found to be essentially equivalent to the anisotropy harmonic previously extracted from two-particle correlation methods. The subleading mode represents a new experimental observable and is shown to account for a large fraction of the factorization breaking recently observed at high transverse momentum.

For central events, the D0 meson yield in the PbPb collisions is suppressed by a factor of 5–6 compared to the pp reference in the pT range of 6–10 GeV/c .

The measurement is motivated by the search for the charge separation phenomenon predicted by the chiral magnetic effect (CME) in heavy ion collisions. Three- and two-particle azimuthal correlators are extracted as functions of the pseudorapidity difference, the transverse momentum (pT) difference, and the pT average of same- and opposite-charge pairs in various event multiplicity ranges. The data suggest that the charge-dependent three-particle correlators with respect to the second- and third-order event planes share a common origin, predominantly arising from charge-dependent two-particle azimuthal correlations coupled with an anisotropic flow. The CME is expected to lead to a v2-independent three-particle correlation when the magnetic field is fixed.

The results of this analysis, both the dominance of two-particle correlations as a source of the three-particle results and the similarities seen between PbPb and pPb, provide stringent constraints on the origin of charge-dependent three-particle azimuthal correlations and challenge their interpretation as arising from a chiral magnetic effect in heavy ion collisions.","['effect: magnetic', 'magnetic field: chiral', 'angular correlation: charge dependence', 'correlation: two-particle', 'correlation function', 'flow: anisotropy', 'phase space', 'event shape analysis', 'background', 'slope', 'heavy ion: scattering', 'rapidity', 'transverse momentum', 'multiplicity', 'engineering', 'lead', 'CMS', 'detector: design', 'CERN LHC Coll', 'numerical calculations', 'experimental results', '8160 GeV/nucleon 5020 GeV/nucleon']",10.1103/PhysRevC.97.044912,
