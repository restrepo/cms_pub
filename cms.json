The ratio of the differential production cross sections of the two states, where systematic uncertainties largely cancel, is also determined. The branching fraction of the inclusive B to psi(2S) X decay is extracted from the ratio of the non-prompt cross sections to be: BR(B to psi(2S) X) = (3.08 +\/- 0.12(stat.+syst.) +\/- 0.13(theor.) +\/- 0.42(BR[PDG])) 10^-3","keywords":["p p: inclusive reaction","J\/psi(3100): hadroproduction","psi(3685): hadroproduction","psi mesons: leptonic decay","dimuon: mass spectrum","charmonium: direct production","B: hadronic decay","B: branching ratio","differential cross section: measured","transverse momentum dependence","rapidity dependence","differential cross section: ratio","polarization","acceptance","efficiency","experimental results","CMS","CERN LHC Coll","p p --> J\/psi(3100) anything","p p --> psi(3685) anything","psi mesons --> muon+ muon-","B --> psi(3685) anything","7000 GeV-cms"],"doi":"10.1007\/JHEP02(2012)011","MA_topics":["Polarization (waves)","Rapidity","Particle physics","Physics","Invariant mass","Nuclear physics","Meson","Inverse","Decay length","Branching fraction","Large Hadron Collider"]},{"CMS_id":8,"report":"BPH-11-002","title":"Search for $ \\mathrm{ B^{0}_{s} } \\to \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ and $ \\mathrm{B}^{0} \\to \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ decays in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV","journal":"PRL 107 (2011) 191802","date":1312156800000,"CTG":"BPH","category":"B Physics and Quarkonia","inspire_id":"921468","abstract":"A search for the rare decays B(s) to dimuons and B0 to dimuons is performed in pp collisions at sqrt(s)=7 TeV, with a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.14 inverse femtobarns, collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC.

The normalized cross section for groomed jets is measured with higher precision than the ungroomed cross section. Semi-analytical calculations of the jet mass beyond leading logarithmic accuracy are compared to data, as well as predictions at leading order and next-to-leading order, which include parton showering and hadronization. Overall, in the normalized cross section, the theoretical predictions agree with the measured cross sections within the uncertainties for masses from 10 to 30% of the jet transverse momentum.","keywords":["p p: colliding beams","jet: pair production","jet: mass","jet: transverse momentum","p p: scattering","channel cross section: measured","mass dependence","transverse momentum: momentum spectrum","quantum chromodynamics: perturbation theory","perturbation theory: higher-order","higher-order: 0","higher-order: 1","numerical calculations: Monte Carlo","dijet","transverse momentum dependence","CERN LHC Coll","hadronization","parton","CMS","experimental results","13000 GeV-cms"],"doi":"10.1007\/JHEP11(2018)113","MA_topics":["Jet (fluid)","Physics","Parton","Nuclear physics","Hadronization","Luminosity (scattering theory)","Monte Carlo method","Cross section (physics)","Proton","Large Hadron Collider"]},{"CMS_id":100,"report":"SMP-16-003","title":"Measurement of differential cross sections for inclusive isolated-photon and photon+jets production in proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = $ 13 TeV","journal":"EPJC 79 (2019) 20","date":1530489600000,"CTG":"SMP","category":"Standard Model Physics","inspire_id":"1680459","abstract":"Measurements of inclusive isolated-photon and photon+jet production in proton\u2013proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13\\,\\text {TeV} $ are presented.

In particular, next-to-leading-order QCD calculations, and two common Monte\u00a0Carlo event generators using different methods to match matrix-element partons with parton showers, appear inconsistent with the data as well as with each other.","keywords":["p p: scattering","jet: associated production","quantum chromodynamics: perturbation theory","parton: showers","higher-order: 1","rapidity spectrum","Monte Carlo","CMS","CERN LHC Coll","photon: hadroproduction","Z0: hadroproduction","p p --> jet photon anything","p p --> Z0 jet","7000 GeV-cms"],"doi":"10.1103\/PhysRevD.88.112009","MA_topics":["Rapidity","Particle physics","Physics","Nuclear physics","Jet (particle physics)","Perturbative QCD","Citation","Creative commons","Large Hadron Collider","Rapidity","Particle physics","Quantum chromodynamics","Physics","Parton","Luminosity (scattering theory)","Jet (particle physics)","Perturbative QCD","Boson","Large Hadron Collider"]},{"CMS_id":38,"report":"SMP-12-002","title":"Measurement of associated W + charm production in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV","journal":"JHEP 02 (2014) 013","date":1381017600000,"CTG":"SMP","category":"Standard Model Physics","inspire_id":"1256938","abstract":"Measurements are presented of the associated production of a W boson and a charm-quark jet (W + c) in pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV.

The corresponding observed (expected) significance amounts to 4.7 (5.2) standard deviations for ${\\mathrm{t}} {{\\overline{{{\\mathrm{t}}}}}} {\\mathrm{H}} $, and to 1.4 (0.3) for ${\\mathrm{t}} {\\mathrm{H}} $ production. Assuming that the Higgs boson coupling to the tau lepton is equal in strength to its expectation in the SM, the coupling $y_{{\\mathrm{t}}}$ of the Higgs boson to the top quark divided by its SM expectation, $\\kappa _{{\\mathrm{t}}}=y_{{\\mathrm{t}}}\/y_{{\\mathrm{t}}}^{\\mathrm {SM}}$, is constrained to be within $-0.9< \\kappa _{{\\mathrm{t}}}< -0.7$ or $0.7< \\kappa _{{\\mathrm{t}}}< 1.1$, at 95% confidence level.

Since the first observation in decays to gamma gamma, WW, and ZZ boson pairs, an extensive set of measurements of the mass and couplings to W and Z bosons, as well as multiple tests of the spin-parity quantum numbers, have revealed that the properties of the new boson are consistent with those of the long-sought agent responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking. An important open question is whether the new particle also couples to fermions, and in particular to down-type fermions, since the current measurements mainly constrain the couplings to the up-type top quark. Determination of the couplings to down-type fermions requires direct measurement of the corresponding Higgs boson decays, as recently reported by the CMS experiment in the study of Higgs decays to bottom quarks and tau leptons. In this paper we report the combination of these two channels which results, for the first time, in strong evidence for the direct coupling of the 125 GeV Higgs boson to down-type fermions, with an observed significance of 3.8 standard deviations, when 4.4 are expected.","keywords":["electroweak interaction: symmetry breaking","Higgs particle: decay modes","CERN LHC Coll","CMS","Higgs particle: hadroproduction","vector boson: associated production","p p: interaction","Higgs particle: coupling","bottom: pair production","tau: pair production","experimental results","p p --> Higgs particle vector boson anything","Higgs particle --> bottom anti-bottom","Higgs particle --> tau+ tau-","7000: 8000 GeV-cms"],"doi":"10.1038\/nphys3005","MA_topics":null},{"CMS_id":29,"report":"HIG-13-004","title":"Evidence for the 125 GeV Higgs boson decaying to a pair of $ \\tau $ leptons","journal":"JHEP 05 (2014) 104","date":1390176000000,"CTG":"HIG","category":"Higgs Physics","inspire_id":"1278199","abstract":"A search for a standard model Higgs boson decaying into a pair of tau leptons is performed using events recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2011 and 2012.

The strongest mass bounds on the neutralinos from gluino and squark decays are 1150 and 575 GeV, respectively. The search also provides sensitivity to simplified models inspired by split SUSY that involve the production and decay of long-lived gluinos. Values of the proper decay length c\u03c4$_{0}$ from 10$^{\u22123}$ to 10$^{5}$ mm are considered, as well as a metastable gluino scenario. Gluino masses up to 1750 and 900 GeV are probed for c\u03c4$_{0}$ = 1 mm and for the metastable state, respectively. The sensitivity is moderately dependent on model assumptions for c\u03c4$_{0}$ \u2273 1 m. The search provides coverage of the c\u03c4$_{0}$ parameter space for models involving long-lived gluinos that is complementary to existing techniques at the LHC.","keywords":["p p: colliding beams","gluino: mass: lower limit","gluino: long-lived","supersymmetry: split","transverse momentum: missing-energy","p p: scattering","gluino: decay","gluino: pair production","squark: decay","decay: length","sbottom: mass: lower limit","stop: mass: lower limit","CERN LHC Coll","sensitivity","neutralino: mass: lower limit","background","CERN Lab","squark: pair production","CMS","experimental results","13000 GeV-cms"],"doi":"10.1007\/JHEP05(2018)025","MA_topics":["Particle physics","Supersymmetry","Physics","Hadron","Split supersymmetry","Gluino","Neutralino","Standard Model","Quark","Large Hadron Collider"]},{"CMS_id":98,"report":"SUS-17-004","title":"Combined search for electroweak production of charginos and neutralinos in proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = $ 13 TeV","journal":"JHEP 03 (2018) 160","date":1515628800000,"CTG":"SUS","category":"Supersymmetry","inspire_id":"1647947","abstract":"A statistical combination of several searches for the electroweak production of charginos and neutralinos is presented.

The sensitivity of the search is validated using multiple methods. No significant deviations from the predictions have been observed. For a wide range of final state topologies, agreement is found between the data and the standard model simulation.

The results of this analysis, both the dominance of two-particle correlations as a source of the three-particle results and the similarities seen between PbPb and pPb, provide stringent constraints on the origin of charge-dependent three-particle azimuthal correlations and challenge their interpretation as arising from a chiral magnetic effect in heavy ion collisions.","keywords":["effect: magnetic","magnetic field: chiral","angular correlation: charge dependence","correlation: two-particle","correlation function","flow: anisotropy","phase space","event shape analysis","background","slope","heavy ion: scattering","rapidity","transverse momentum","multiplicity","engineering","lead","CMS","detector: design","CERN LHC Coll","numerical calculations","experimental results","8160 GeV\/nucleon 5020 GeV\/nucleon"],"doi":"10.1103\/PhysRevC.97.044912","MA_topics":null},{"CMS_id":59,"report":"HIN-16-008","title":"Suppression of excited ${\\Upsilon} $ states relative to the ground state in PbPb collisions at ${\\sqrt{{s_{_{\\mathrm{NN}}}}}} = $ 5.02 TeV","journal":"PRL 120 (2018) 142301","date":1497830400000,"CTG":"HIN","category":"Heavy-Ion Physics","inspire_id":"1605750","abstract":"The relative yields of \u03d2 mesons produced in pp and Pb-Pb collisions at sNN=5.02\u2009\u2009TeV and reconstructed via the dimuon decay channel are measured using data collected by the CMS experiment.
